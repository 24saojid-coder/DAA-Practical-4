# DAA-Practical-4
Aim: Implement maximum sum of subarray for the given scenario of resource allocation using the divide and conquer approach.

Problem Statement:
A project requires allocating resources to various tasks over a period of time. Each task
requires a certain amount of resources, and you want to maximize the overall efficiency of
resource usage. You&#39;re given an array resources where resources[i] represents the amount of
resources required for the i th task. Your goal is to find the contiguous subarray of tasks that
maximizes the total resources utilized without exceeding a given resource constraint.
Handle cases where the total resources exceed the constraint by adjusting the subarray
window accordingly. Your implementation should handle various cases, including scenarios
where there&#39;s no feasible subarray given the constraint and scenarios where multiple
subarrays yield the same maximum resource utilization.
